The MINOX is a **vendor independent deep learning library, compiler and inference framework** designed for small form-factor devices including **μControllers, IoT and Edge devices**

## 🏃‍♂️ Using MINOX

Here are few of many ways.

1. Try deepC with [Colab Noteboook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EKgQcMCHr-0OsG9qJ4wXv7J4JFlPY7CK)
1. Install it on Ubuntu, raspbian (or any other debian derivatives) using ```pip install deepC```
1. Compile onnx model- [read this article](test/compiler/mnist/README.md) or [watch this video](https://youtu.be/BpFs83MU3HM)
1. Use deepC with a [Docker File](Dockerfile)

See more examples in [tutorial](tutorials/README.md) dir.

## 📛 what is MINOX?

MINOX library, compiler and inference framework is designed to **enable and perform** deep learning neural networks by focussing on features of small form-factor devices like micro-controllers, eFPGAs, cpus and other embedded devices like [raspberry-pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), [odroid](https://www.hardkernel.com/), [arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), [SparkFun Edge](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15170), [risc-V](https://www.amazon.com/Seeed-Studio-Sipeed-Maixduino-RISC-V/dp/B07SW9ZWQQ), mobile phones, x86 and arm laptops among others.

![edge Devices](assets/edgeDevices.png "supported edge devices")

MINOX also offers ahead of time compiler producing optimized executable based on [LLVM compiler tool chain](https://llvm.org/) specialized for deep neural networks with [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) as front end.

## 📝 Design

Main components of **MINOX** have been designed to represent and optimize the common deep learning networks in high level graph IR and to transform the computation graph to minimize memory utilization, optimize data layout and fuse computation patterns for different hardware backends.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Why compiler❔
deepC is targeted towards devices with small formfactor like microcontrollers, which are part of all sorts of household devices: think appliances, cars, and toys. In fact, there are around 30 billion microcontroller-powered devices produced each year. They're cheap, require very little energy, and are very reliable.

By bringing deep learning models to tiny microcontrollers, we can boost the intelligence of billions of devices that we use in our lives, without relying on expensive hardware or reliable internet connections. Imagine smart appliances that can adapt to your daily routine, intelligent industrial sensors that understand the difference between problems and normal operation, and magical toys that can help kids learn in fun and delightful ways.
